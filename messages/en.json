    "catenion": "Began as a Data Science working student in 2020 and transitioned to a full-time role after completing my Master's in Data Science. My focus evolved from Data Science to Data Engineering, and ultimately to Data Architecture. In addition to designing and improving data pipelines and architecture, I developed data-driven web applications and managed the entire IT infrastructure for the Data Unit. For the past year, I have been leading a small data team, including two working students.",
    "sopraSteri": "As a working student, I conducted research in AI and Data Science. This role provided me with foundational experience in the field and prepared me for more project-oriented work in subsequent positions.",
    "helmholtz": "Completed a Computer Science Apprenticeship through a dual study program, where I applied academic knowledge to practical projects at a major research institution."

    "wismar": "Driven by a passion for continuous learning, I pursued a second Master's degree in Cyber Security. This program allowed me to rediscover my interest in algebra, leading to a Master's thesis on Homomorphic Encryption with Module-Learning with Errors (M-LWE). I graduated with an overall grade of 1.3.",
    "bht": "This practical Master's program provided extensive knowledge of various AI models and their underlying infrastructure. A course on virtualization and containers proved particularly influential, and I now use these techniques, especially Dev Containers, daily. I graduated with an overall grade of 1.3 and distinction.",
